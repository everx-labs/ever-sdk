/// Creates a subscription
///
/// Triggers for each insert/update of data that satisfies 
/// the `filter` conditions.
/// The projection fields are limited to `result` fields.
/// 
/// The subscription is a persistent communication channel between 
/// client and Free TON Network.
/// All changes in the blockchain will be reflected in realtime.
/// Changes means inserts and updates of the blockchain entities.
/// 
/// ### Important Notes on Subscriptions
/// 
/// Unfortunately sometimes the connection with the network brakes down.
/// In this situation the library attempts to reconnect to the network.
/// This reconnection sequence can take significant time.
/// All of this time the client is disconnected from the network.
/// 
/// Bad news is that all blockchain changes that happened while
/// the client was disconnected are lost.
/// 
/// Good news is that the client report errors to the callback when 
/// it loses and resumes connection.
/// 
/// So, if the lost changes are important to the application then 
/// the application must handle these error reports.
/// 
/// Library reports errors with `responseType` == 101 
/// and the error object passed via `params`.
/// 
/// When the library has successfully reconnected
/// the application receives callback with 
/// `responseType` == 101 and `params.code` == 614 (NetworkModuleResumed).
/// 
/// Application can use several ways to handle this situation:
/// - If application monitors changes for the single blockchain 
/// object (for example specific account):  application 
/// can perform a query for this object and handle actual data as a
/// regular data from the subscription.
/// - If application monitors sequence of some blockchain objects
/// (for example transactions of the specific account): application must 
/// refresh all cached (or visible to user) lists where this sequences presents.
